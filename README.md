### What's cooking?

[ ] This project was fun!
[ ]  Implementation of useState and useEffect
[ ] passed Functions as props to the child components
[ ] Takeaway from this project is that we can send state from parent to children and partially from children to parent but not between two child components of different parents.
[ ] Hence I came to know to that contextAPI is useful in such cases.
[ ] therefore this gave me an insight to why we use redux or any other state management system in react.
