### What's cooking?

- [x] This project was fun!
- [x] Implementation of useState and useEffect
- [x] passed Functions as props to the child components
- [x] Takeaway from this project is that we can send state from parent to children and partially from children to parent but not between two child components of different parents.
- [x] Hence I came to know to that contextAPI is useful in such cases.
- [x] therefore this gave me an insight to why we use redux or any other state management system in react.
